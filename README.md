<h1>EUROPEAN SOCCCER DATABASE</h1>

<h2>In this exercise we will analyze a database on European football matches to know the data in our possession and extrapolate interesting information</h2>

<p><h3>The tools used</h3>
<li>Data Analysis: SQL on Google Bigquery</li>
<li>Supporting graphs: Python on Google Colaboratory</li>
<li>Presentation: Google Slides</li></p>

<p><h3>The composition of database</h3>
<li>match;</li>
<li>leagues;</li>
<li>team;</li>
<li>player.</li></p>

<p>First, the size of the `match` dataset was analyzed to verify <b>how many matches</b> and **how many leagues** were present.

<p>Subsequently the <b>time range</b> and <b>how many games were played per season</b>.</p>

<p>By analyzing the number of matches per league, an anomalous case was discovered regarding the Belgium Jupiler League.</p>

<p>The <b>total number of matches played for each month</b> was then subsequently analysed.</p>

<p>An in-depth analysis was also done regarding the <b>statistics and goals scored in each season and for each league</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>players</b> were then analysed. The weight was converted into kg. A jointplot shows the strong correlation between weight and height. This indicates that our athletes are all quite fit. Only 7.8% of them do not have an optimal BMI.</p>

<p>Finally, the <b>highest score of the last season</b> was analyzed, <b>the team that was the best for the most seasons</b> and a <b>table</b> was created with the <b>10 teams that scored the most goals</b>.</p>

<p>You can find in this <i>repository</i> all the material to repeat the exercise yourself.</p>

<p>Thanks for your attention</p>
